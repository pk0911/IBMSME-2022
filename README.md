## DAY -2 10 November2022    WorkFlow 

Workflow is a series of inter-dependent tasks that are needed to be followed in order to achieve a desired output.

Learnt and worked on Alteryx powered by Trifacta
Alteryx : Self-Service Analytics, Data Science & Automation tool which is designed for analysts to explore, transform, and enrich raw data into clean and structured formats.

I analyzed the dataset of COVID-19 and its Impact on Students having 19 columns  in csv file format.
The dataset consisted a sample size of 1182 students of different age groups from different educational institutions in Delhi National Capital Region (NCR). 

The first step of my analysis was to review data and search for any missing values and remove them inorder to get the most suitable and accurate outcome. 
Then by performing some basic calculations, and by calculating the total Screen time ,I analyzed how the usuage of gadgets affected the self study and health of students. 

By using various data visualization tools we are going to plot the graphs of the analyzed data.

## DAY-3 11th November 2022    Data Visualization

Utilized the idea of data storytelling and used visualization tools to portray the workflow in graphical manner.

Some of the conclusions drawn from the data are listed below:
1. Impact of Covid 19 on Health: During COVID 19,  students' screen usage rose but it did not significantly affect their weight and sleep pattern. Also
   the students who indulged in fitness activities during Covid-19 period did not see any change in their weight.
   
2. Impact of Covid 19 on Education: Online lessons during Covid-19 period were most frequently taken on laptops or desktop computers. The analysis shows 
   that even though online classes were the optimal solution during the COVID 19 period, yet most of the students did not enjoy the experience.
   Additionally, we can also conclude that social media had a big impact on students' academic performance throughout the lockdown.  
   
3. Usage and effect of Social Media during Covid-19: During COVID 19 period , the three most popular social media networks were YouTube, Instagram, and            WhatsApp.

Through our analysis, we came to the conclusion that  the Covid-19 outbreak has made a significant impact on the health, education, and daily routine of students. We analyzed various digital social media tools used by students as a self-management strategy for health. Our analysis addresses key concerns related to online education and health due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Limited class interaction and inefficient time table significantly affected the satisfaction levels among students. The peer-to-peer impact in the school environment motivates individuals to work hard and learn social skills, which may not be possible in an online setting during the Covid.

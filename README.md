Learnt and worked on Alteryx powered by Trifacta
Alteryx : Self-Service Analytics, Data Science & Automation tool which is designed for analysts to explore, transform, and enrich raw data into clean and structured formats.

I analyzed the dataset of COVID-19 and its Impact on Students having 19 columns  in csv file format.
The dataset consisted a sample size of 1182 students of different age groups from different educational institutions in Delhi National Capital Region (NCR). 

The first step of my analysis was to review data and search for any missing values and remove them inorder to get the most suitable and accurate outcome. 
Then by performing some basic calculations, and by calculating the total Screen time ,I analyzed how the usuage of gadgets affected the self study and health of students. 

By using various data visualization tools we are going to plot the graphs of the analyzed data.
